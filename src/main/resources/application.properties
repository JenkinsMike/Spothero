## i wish i knew why everything is showing as an "unused property"...
####
## Extra Credit.  Probably not as fulsome as some, but I used the
## SpringBoot Actuator and the Hal Explorer (formally Hal Browser).
## I limited the exposed methods
####
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=autoconfig,beans,configprops,diskspace,env,features,health,mappings,metrics,ping,refresh
management.endpoints.jmx.exposure.include=autoconfig,beans,configprops,diskspace,env,features,health,mappings,metrics,ping,refresh
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-components=always
management.endpoint.health.group.custom.show-details=always

## At one point I was not catching all of the errors I wanted to, but still did not
## want to see the Stacktrace in Swagger.  So, never show it.
####
server.error.include-stacktrace=never
####
## This is how I do the versioning for the actuator - info.  I am not doing anything fancy
## here, so I am just leaving this for nothing much more than personal attachment.
